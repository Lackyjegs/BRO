<h2>What is the BRO?</h2>
<p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra was founded in the year 2000 by Townsville locals involved with music who felt jcu students would
 fit having a real orchestra and to keep knowledged people occupied, which meeans the Orchestra is over 16 years old!
 . The Barrier Reef Orchestra consists of people from a wide array of places and ages, where the youngest member is 13 years old and
 the oldest member is 73 years old. Like all great orchestras, the Barrier Reef Orchestra contains 4 sections of instruments: Toots
 (Trumpets etc), Whistles (Flutes etc), Plucks  (Violins etc)and Booms (Drums etc). The orchestra also contains temporary conductors
 who usually travel just to  do their part for the orchestra. The Barrier Reef Orchestra is constantly improving, rehearsing for 6 weeks before
 every concert making their mark all over Australia with great Classical music, including the well known Australian Festival of Chamber music 
 in Queens Gardens and commonly in the Civic Theatre here in Townsville.</p></li></div>
